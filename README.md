# Spaceship-Titanic-Competition-
 Introduction
  To assist with the rescue efforts of the lost passengers, we must first comprehend the situation at hand.
  In 2912, the Spaceship Titanic, a vessel designed for interstellar travel, collided with an anomaly in spacetime concealed within a dust cloud. Regrettably, the ship suffered a similar fate as its historical namesake, transporting almost half its passengers to an alternate dimension. Although the ship remained intact, our responsibility was to analyze data retrieved from its damaged computer system and use it to predict which passengers were affected by this phenomenon(Duprey & O’Leary, 1983).
  Our task is to support the rescue operation by predicting which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records from the remains of the computer system. We will employ a machine learning process to solve this problem. Our approach will be to categorize data points into two buckets, transported or not transported, which will give the rescue team information on which passengers to recover and other characteristics or features that can support the rescue mission.
  This is a binary classification problem, where we must predict whether or not a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension. We will be using the accuracy metric to evaluate our predictions' accuracy (Duprey & O’Leary, 1983).
